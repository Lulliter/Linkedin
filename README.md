## Study of jobs and competitivity of cities 
This mini-study project was an exercise I completed within the interview process with IFC (in collaboration with LinkdIn). 
It was an opportunity to refresh some R and try use the `xaringan` package to make html presentations. 

## Publishing as  github page
Later on I follow the instructions (& example repo) found here [xaringan_gh](https://github.com/tcgriffith/xaringan_gh) to figure out how to publish the obtained html presentation using github page


## PROCESS:

- Clone this repo (or recreate similar) with the key files in teh `./docs/` sub-folder 
- setup github pages: `Settings` - `Github Pages`- `source: master branch/docs folder`
- Done! The slides can be viewed online at the url on the setting page. 
(For example, https://lulliter.github.io/Linkedin/ is the link for this repo.)
